					  Dr. Dyer received his DDS degree from Baylor College of Dentistry and earned a Master of Science in Periodontics at the University of Texas Dental School in Houston. He has been striving to develop and master the most effective periodontal procedures for his patients since opening his private practice in 1991.

						Dr. Dyer was one of the first periodontists to receive a grant for research in private practice from the American Periodontal Foundation. With the grant, he began conducting clinical research in his practice and treating patients on a full-time basis. His research in guided tissue regeneration, cosmetic surgery, and laser periodontal treatment has been published in reputable journals, such as international publication The Journal of Periodontology.

						A few of his accomplishments include a Mastership certification from the WCLI and serving as the chief investigator for Biolase in obtaining FDA clearance for periodontal treatment with the Er:Cr:YSGG laser. Dr. Dyer has committed a large portion of his career to lasers for its surgical and regenerative benefits.
